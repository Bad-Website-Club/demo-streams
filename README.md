# Bad Website Club Demo

Thank you so much for joining us and teaching us how we can go make bad websites with the tech you'll teach us!

This doc will cover some essentials before we get started.

## Tech Setup
  
We’ll be using StreamYard to host the live chat. All you’ll need is a browser that can open the link. You should get a link to the StreamYard instance along with these instructions in the calendar entry for the demo!

When you enter StreamYard, you’ll be prompted to enter your display name. Please enter it including your pronouns should you wish to share them. For example:

    Ramón (he/him)

Please turn on your 'Do not disturb' settings on the computer you're streaming from, to be sure that these aren't accidentally shared via screenshares.

If you have a dedicated microphone you like to chat with, that’s wonderful! If not, we highly recommend using, say, some smartphone earphones with a microphone that’s close to your mouth. The built-in microphone on your computer isn't the worst alternative, but if you have another, that'd be grand!

If you can, we’d also recommend using a wired ethernet connection, but it’s not a big deal if not!

## Behaviour

We expect our hosts and guests on the show to lead by example. Respectful, non-harmful behaviour is required. Please do not use disparaging, foul language.

We expect everyone, ourselves included, to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://bit.ly/bwc-coc).

## Timing
  
We start at the time listed on the calendar, but please if you can join the StreamYard call 15 minutes before the top of the hour to make sure we're all set up, tech wise.

It's also a good idea to make sure your screen is being shared before we start. Two things worth of note here:

1. We can hide your screen, so no need to unshare it. This way, we can avoid the "let me share my screen" pause.
2. We can make sure that the browser/editor is zoomed enough so folks watching on mobile can see it well!

The amount of time allotted on the calendar is a guideline. Please don't worry about sticking stricly to it! If we find a natural stopping point, we'll draw it to a close. If we go a little over (your schedule allowing), that's fine, too!

The timing will be approximately as follows:

- (10 min. before) Quick tech check and explanation of StreamYard stuff
- (a few moments before) Start the stream so the notifications start going out to our followers
- (5 min.) Jess and Ramón kick things off, introduce Bad Website Club, some housekeeping
- (5 min.) We introduce you, and bring you on, allow you to tell us more about yourself
- (40 min.) Demo time! We'll be hanging out backstage, moderating chat, bookmarking questions so you don't have to keep an eye on them
- (10 min.) Q&A — We'll bring up questions from the chat.
- (1 min.) Outtro, calls-to-action and goodbyes

When we wrap up, **you don't need to close the browser window**! We'll take us off the air and we can debrief/exhale as needed! :relieved: 

## VOD (video on demand)
  
The video will be streamed and stored on [our YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@badwebsiteclub).

## Moderation and chat
  
Don’t worry about any of this, we’ll handle it all for you! When there are relevant questions or comments from chat, your host will read them aloud for you to address. 

## Promotion
  
We’ll be spreading the word on on our social channels leading up to the stream. 

Feel free to share the YouTube livestream link with your communities as you feel needed, please!
